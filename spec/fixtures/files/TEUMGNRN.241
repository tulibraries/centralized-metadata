Rather than simply being versions of contemporary stories transported to a historical setting, Regency novels are a distinct genre with their own plot and stylistic conventions that derive from the works of Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer, and from the fiction genre known as the novel of manners. In particular, most Regencies feature a great deal of intelligent, fast-paced dialog between the protagonists and (traditionally) very little explicit sex or discussion of sex. Other common elements of Regency romances include mystery or farce elements in the plot; references to the Ton (le bon ton); a secondary romance between another couple in addition to the more serious story involving the main protagonists; mistaken identity (deliberate or otherwise); false engagements; marriages of convenience; depictions of activities common during the social season such as balls, routs, carriage riding, theatre events, fittings, suppers, assemblies, etc.; references to, or descriptions of, leisure activities engaged in by fashionable young men of the period, including riding, driving, boxing, gambling, fencing, shooting, etc.)  aMoore, H.

An example of a site like this is MSN.com. Another type of news site is the site that is completely devoted to news. These sites may include all types of news like political, judicial, entertainment, sports or more. An example of this type of site is CNN.com.
